# Automated Feature Engineering with Featuretools 
  
In this notebook, I'll work with Featuretools to develop an automated feature engineering workflow for the customer churn dataset. The end outcome is a function that takes in a dataset and label times for customers and builds a feature matrix that can be used to train a machine learning model to predict customer churn.
